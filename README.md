# VaultMoneyDeath
A simple Spigot plugin that allows you to change the money a player has on death using Vault

## Installation
This plugin is currently not on any popular Minecraft plugin distribution site. This may be changed in the future. Currently, the only way to download this plugin for usage on a server is to build from source. You can do that with maven, and if you do not know how to do that, maybe you should research about it.

## Usage
This plugin works entirely on it's own without any commands. All you must do is set a multiplier in the config.yml which would be the multiplier for a player balance on the case that the player dies.
